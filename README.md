## Summary
Assume a bank which provides services (i.e., deposit, withdraw, and transfer) to a collection of up to 6 clients
(i.e., when a 7th client is attempted to be added to the bank, there should be an error message displayed).
Each client can be characterized by their name, numerical balance, and a history (i.e., collection) of up to
10 (for this you can assume that the user will not complete more than 10 transactions for each client). Each
client should be identified by their name. We may want to perform one of the following kinds of transactions:

- Deposit some amount of money **to** a client’s account.
- Withdraw some amount of money **from** a client’s account.
- Transfer some amount of money **from** a client’s account **to** another client’s account.
